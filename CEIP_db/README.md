# To set up this database


# Instructions from Bing 
I see. In that case, you need to install SQL Server on your Mac first before you can restore a .bak file. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Download and install Docker Community Edition for Mac from the official Docker download pageÂ². Docker is a platform that enables you to run SQL Server as a container on your Mac.
2. Launch Docker and increase the memory allocated to it to at least 4GB from the Preferences menuÂ².
3. Open a terminal window and run the following command to download the SQL Server 2019 for Linux Docker image: `sudo docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest`Â¹Â².
4. Run the following command to launch the SQL Server image in Docker: `docker run -d --name example_sql_server -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=Strong.Pwd-123' -p 1433:1433 mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest`Â¹. This will create a SQL Server instance named example_sql_server with the password Strong.Pwd-123. You can change these values as you wish, but make sure the password is strong enough.
5. Run the following command to check the status of the SQL Server Docker container: `docker ps -a`Â¹. If the output says Up, the container is running successfully.
6. Install SQL Server command-line tool by running the following command: `brew install mssql-tools`Â¹. This will allow you to connect to SQL Server from the terminal.
7. Connect to SQL Server by running the following command: `sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P Strong.Pwd-123`Â¹. This will use the same credentials as you specified in step 4. You should see a prompt that says 1>.
8. Now you can follow the steps from my previous message to restore a .bak file using Azure Data Studio.

I hope this helps you with your task. If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know.

I understand your frustration, but I'm here to help.ðŸ˜Š

To restore a .bak file in Azure Data Studio, you need to follow these steps:

1. Connect to your SQL Server instance using Azure Data Studio.
2. Click the Restore button on the Server Dashboard or right-click on an existing database and select Restore from the contextual menuÂ¹Â².
3. Select Backup file from the first dropdown menu and click the ellipses (...) to open the file explorerÂ¹Â².
4. Navigate to the folder where your .bak file is located and select it. Make sure the SQL Server service has READ permissions on the backup fileÂ¹.
5. Enter a name for the target database in the Destination section or use the default nameÂ¹Â².
6. Click Restore and wait for the process to complete. You can view the status of the restore operation in the Task History paneÂ¹Â².
7. Once the restore is complete, you can see your new database in the list of databases under your server. You might need to refresh the list by right-clicking on Databases and selecting RefreshÂ².
8. To test your database, you can run some queries on it or right-click on a table and select Select Top 1000Â².

I hope this helps you with your task. If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know.

### Restoring a .bak file into a full SQL database with Docker on Mac
Here's a step-by-step guide to restore a .bak file into a full SQL database using Docker on your Mac:

Install Docker Desktop for Mac, if you haven't already. You can find the installation guide here: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/

Pull the latest SQL Server image for Linux:

bash
Copy code
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
Run the SQL Server Docker container with a custom name, exposing the default SQL Server port (1433), and setting the SA password:
arduino
Copy code
docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrongPassword>' --name sql_server_container -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
Replace <YourStrongPassword> with a strong password for the sa user.

Copy the .bak file into the Docker container:
bash
Copy code
docker cp /path/to/your/database.bak sql_server_container:/var/opt/mssql/backup/database.bak
Replace /path/to/your/database.bak with the actual path to your .bak file.

Connect to the SQL Server instance in the Docker container using the sqlcmd utility, which is included in the SQL Server image:
bash
Copy code
docker exec -it sql_server_container /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P <YourStrongPassword>
Replace <YourStrongPassword> with the password you set in step 3.

You are now connected to the SQL Server instance. Restore the .bak file by running the following commands in the sqlcmd prompt:
List the contents of the backup file:

css
Copy code
RESTORE FILELISTONLY FROM DISK = '/var/opt/mssql/backup/database.bak';
GO
Take note of the LogicalName values for the data and log files. You'll use them in the next step.

Restore the database:

sql
Copy code
RESTORE DATABASE YourDatabaseName
FROM DISK = '/var/opt/mssql/backup/database.bak'
WITH MOVE '<DataLogicalName>' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/YourDatabaseName.mdf',
MOVE '<LogLogicalName>' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/YourDatabaseName.ldf';
GO
Replace YourDatabaseName with the desired name for your database, and <DataLogicalName> and <LogLogicalName> with the respective logical names obtained in the previous step.

The database is now restored. Type exit to quit the sqlcmd utility.

To access the database, you can use a SQL client like Azure Data Studio. Download and install it from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio.

Open Azure Data Studio, click on "New Connection," and enter the following information:

Server: localhost,1433
Authentication type: SQL Login
User name: sa
Password: <YourStrongPassword>
Click "Connect"
Now you should be connected to your SQL Server instance in the Docker container, and you can see the restored database under the "Databases" folder.

Note that this setup is for local use only. If you want to share the database with others, you'll need to set up a SQL Server instance on a server or cloud platform and follow the steps in my previous response to allow other users to access it.

### Unpacking the .bak file into .csv files


### Setting up a shareable SQL server instance 
If you want to share the database with others on your GitHub repository, you can convert the database to a portable format like SQL scripts or CSV files. This way, users can download the files and import them into their own SQL Server instances. Here's how to do it:

Install Docker and run SQL Server as described in my previous response.

Restore the .bak file to a SQL Server instance running in a Docker container, also as described in my previous response.

Connect to the SQL Server instance using Azure Data Studio, as explained in the previous response.

Right-click on your database, choose "Tasks," and then select "Export Data-tier Application."

Save the .bacpac file to your local machine.

Extract the schema and data from the .bacpac file using the SqlPackage utility. Download and install SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) for Visual Studio, which includes the SqlPackage utility: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt

Open the terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the directory where the SqlPackage utility is installed (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\SQLDB\DAC\150 on Windows).

Run the following command to extract the schema and data from the .bacpac file:

bash
Copy code
./SqlPackage /a:Export /sf:/path/to/your/database.bacpac /tf:/path/to/your/output/folder/database.sql
Replace /path/to/your/database.bacpac with the path to your .bacpac file, and /path/to/your/output/folder with the path where you want to save the extracted SQL file.

Commit the generated SQL file to your GitHub repository.
Users who want to access the database can now clone your repository, import the SQL file into their own SQL Server instances, and run SQL commands on the imported data. To import the SQL file, they can use a tool like Azure Data Studio or SQL Server Management Studio.

Keep in mind that this approach shares a static snapshot of the database, and changes made by users will not be reflected in the original database. If you need to keep the data synchronized between users, you'll need to set up a central SQL Server instance and provide users with credentials to access it, as described in one of my previous responses.
